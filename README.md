*Code and results for the disruption of axion miniclusters (AMCs) in the Milky Way, as well as radio signals from encounters between AMCs and neutrons stars.*

The key parts of the computation are:
* Calculation of the perturbations to individual AMCs due to stellar encounters ([`code/Distribution_PL.ipynb`](code/Distribution_PL.ipynb) and [`code/Distribution_NFW.ipynb`](code/Distribution_NFW.ipynb)) 
* Monte Carlo simulations of the disruption of individual AMCs orbiting in the Milky Way ([`code/MonteCarlo.py`](code/MonteCarlo.py))  
* Processing and calculation of the distributions of AMC properties from the Monte Carlo results ([`code/prepare_distributions.py`](code/prepare_distributions.py))  
* Sampling of properties of individual encounters between AMCs and neutrons stars in the Milky Way ([`code/simulate_signal.py`](code/simulate_signal.py))

Scripts for generating plots from the results are in [`code/plotting/`](code/plotting). The first thing to do is to edit [`code/dirs.py`](code/dirs.py) so that the directory variables point to the right place.

**An example script showing how to run the pipeline 'end-to-end' is given in [`code/RunPipeline.py`](code/RunPipeline.py).**

The raw Monte Carlo results are archived online at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13224386.v1. Edit the file [`code/dirs.py`](code/dirs.py) to specify the directory where these Monte Carlo results are located (though the raw files are only needed if you want to re-calculate the AMC distributions).

Full samples of radio signal events due to AMC-NS encounters are archived online at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13204856.v1. These should be placed in the [`data/`](data/) folder. The full samples contain 10^7 events each; without these the plotting scripts will use instead the 'short' sample files provided, each of which is 10^5 events.

### Re-interpreting the results

If you would like to re-compute the AMC distributions assuming a different axion mass or initial mass function, the mass function can be specified in [`code/mass_function.py`](code/mass_function.py). For a power-law mass function, you can simply edit the command
```python
AMC_MF = mass_function.PowerLawMassFunction(m_a, gamma)
```
in the scripts [`code/prepare_distributions.py`](code/prepare_distributions.py) and [`code/simulate_signal.py`](code/simulate_signal.py). The new AMC distributions and signal samples can then be computed with 
```bash
./GetDistributions.sh
```
and 
```bash
./GetSignals.sh
```
Note that these commands will replace the distribution and signal sample files which are already in the repository. You can specify the `IDstr` variable hard-coded in [`code/prepare_distributions.py`](code/prepare_distributions.py) and [`code/simulate_signal.py`](code/simulate_signal.py) to add a file suffix so that the old files are not overwritten.

**Setting different parameters:** Inevitably, you'll want to specify different parameters to the simulations, as well as differentiating between different simulations. The file [`code/params.py`](code/params.py) allows you to do this relatively straight-forwardly. At the moment, it allows you to specify:
- The axion mass `m_a`  
- The minimum density enhancement `k` to consider inside axion miniclusters (that is, encounters for which the AMC internal density does not exceed the smooth Galactic background density by at least a factor `k` will be ignore)  
- An identification string, which will be used to save output files: `IDstr`.

### Generating quick results with delta-function mass functions

As of July 2021, new scripts have been added for preparing distributions and simulating signals for *delta-function mass functions of AMCs* - [`code/prepare_distributions_delta.py`](code/prepare_distributions_delta.py) and [`code/simulate_signal_delta.py`](code/simulate_signal_delta.py). These scripts accept the flag `-mass_choice` with `-mass_choice c` fixing the AMC mass to be equal to the characteristic AMC mass `M_0` and `-mass_choice a` fixing the AMC mass to be equal to the mean AMC mass, given a power-law mass function. The files which are output by these scripts will have filenames appended with `_delta_a` or `_delta_c`, along with whatever value of `IDstr` is specified in the `params.py` file. 

To run these scripts, you'll need to download the raw Monte Carlo data files mentioned above. However, you shouldn't need to re-run Monte Carlos, as the characteristic and mean AMC masses are almost always well within the range of masses which were simulated. 

As a rough example of running the full pipeline in this case, you could run:
```bash
python3 prepare_distributions_delta.py -profile PL -mass_choice a -AScut -max_rows 10000
python3 simulate_signal_delta.py -profile PL -mass_choice a -AScut -Ne 1e5
```
This should save a list of encounters in the `data/` folder (in two different formats, depending on how you want to use them). You can also then run [`code/plotting/CalcEncounterRate.py`](code/plotting/CalcEncounterRate.py) (passing the appropriate `-IDstr` flag) to calculate the total encounter rate.
